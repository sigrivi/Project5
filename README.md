# Project5

project5c.py contains three solver for the 1D diffusion equation: the explicit scheme, the implicit scheme, crank nicolson
project5f.py contains an explicit scheme for solving the 2D diffuion equation
benchmarks.txt contains benchmark calculations for both programs.
the code in this repository is a part of project 5 in FYS4150 : http://compphysics.github.io/ComputationalPhysics/doc/Projects/2017/Project5/DiffusionEquation/html/DiffusionEquation.html
